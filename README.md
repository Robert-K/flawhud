A custom Heads-Up Display (HUD) for Team Fortress 2, edited to support triple monitor setups (5760x1080)

#### Notice
Not every HUD element has been adjusted to work with three monitors; the main menu, scoreboard and some unimportant in-game HUD elements might appear incorrectly (or not at all). Though using this HUD is already better than vanilla on triple monitors, I will continue to update this fork until it allows for a clean experience.

#### Installation
Extract the zipped file contents into `Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom`

#### Custom Crosshairs (KnucklesCrosses)
Custom crosshairs are disabled by default - to turn them on; go to `flawhud\scripts\hudlayout.res` and under the `KnucklesCrosses` node change the values to the right of `visible` and `enabled` from 0 to 1.

To change the crosshair style, in the same node change the letter to the right of `labelText` to the corresponding crosshair letter found in the KnucklesCrosses.png image file (located in the `scripts` folder).

#### Favorite Server
This heart shaped button is located on the top right section of the main menu, above the Twitch button. To add your favorite server, go to `resource\gamemenu.res` and under `FavoriteServer` replace the Xs with the server IP and password.

#### Transparent Viewmodels
While the necessary files and entry in hudslayout.res (disabled by default) are included, the config necessary to use Transparent Viewmodels will not be included. This is due to a number of users experiencing issues relating to their own graphical setup, therefore you're responsible for acquiring and modifying your configs accordingly. For more information, visit the TF.TV thread [here](http://www.teamfortress.tv/21928/transparent-viewmodels-in-any-hud).

#### CastingEssentials
There are several features that require [CastingEssentials](https://github.com/PazerOP/CastingEssentials/releases), including MediGun and Team Score panels - both used in the Tournament Spectator, either in demo or SourceTV. For information on how to enable them go to the [CastingEssentials wiki](https://github.com/PazerOP/CastingEssentials/wiki).
